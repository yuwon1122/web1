<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting language first developed by Netscape to enable Web authors to design interactive sites. Although it shares many of the features and structures of the full Java language, it was developed independently. Javascript can interact with HTMLsource code, enabling Web authors to spice up their sites with dynamic content.
Today, JavaScript is endorsed by a number of software companies and is an open language that anyone can use without purchasing a license.</p>
